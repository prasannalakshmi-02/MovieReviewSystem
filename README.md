# 🎬 Movie Review System

A console-based Java application that allows users to add movies, rate them, and view average ratings. This project demonstrates key Java concepts such as OOP, file handling, and collection frameworks, while following a layered architecture using services and models.

## 📁 Project Structure


- **Main.java** – Entry point of the application
- **Data/**
  - `LoadData.java` – Loads user data from CSV
  - `LoadMovies.java` – Loads movie data from CSV
  - `LoadRatings.java` – Loads rating data from CSV
- **Model/**
  - `User.java`, `Movies.java`, `Rating.java` – Entity classes
  - `Cast.java`, `Crew.java` – Additional metadata classes
- **Service/**
  - `UserOperations.java`, `MovieOperations.java`, `RatingsOperations.java` – Interfaces for business logic
- **ServiceImpl/**
  - `UserOperationsImpl.java`, `MovieOperationsImpl.java`, `RatingsOperationsImpl.java`, `Application.java`, `ApplicationOperations.java` – Implementation of service logic


## 🧠 Features

- Add users, movies, and ratings via console
- Store data using CSV files and load them with file handling
- Use of `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `Set` for efficient in-memory data management
- Calculate and display average movie ratings
- Modular codebase following separation of concerns with interfaces and implementations

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasannalakshmi-02/MovieReviewSystem.git


2. Open in any IDE (Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)
3. Ensure the CSV files (`users.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`) are available at the right path
4. Run `Main.java` to interact via console



## 📖 Learning Highlights

* Practical implementation of object-oriented design
* Working with Java Collections and file I/O
* Structuring a real-world console project with layers (Model, Service, Implementation)
* Handling CSV data parsing using `BufferedReader`
